## e621

e621's takedown policy is available [here](https://e621.net/static/takedown).

You may request a takedown if any of the following are true:
* You are the legal copyright holder of the artwork
* You are the legal copyright holder of a character depicted in the artwork
* You commissioned the artwork

You can submit a takedown request using their
[takedown form](https://e621.net/takedowns/new) without needing an account.
After submission, you will need to verify your page by sending a DM from your
gallery page or email from your website's address.

If you are the artist of the artwork, you can ask to be added to the do not post
list as part of your takedown request.

## F-list

F-list's takedown policy is available
[here](https://wiki.f-list.net/Art_Takedown_Requests).

You may request a takedown if any of the following are true:
* You are the owner of the artwork
* You are the artist who made the artwork

In order to make the request, you must:
* Prove your identity, by including the ticket number on your social media,
  website, etc.
* Prove your ownership, by including links to artwork referencing your identity,
  sending source files for the artwork (.PSD or similar), screenshotting private
  messages from the commissioning process, or by having signed your artwork with
  an unambiguous signature.

You can submit a takedown request using their
[contact form](https://www.f-list.net/contact/) without needing an account.

If you are the artist of the artwork, you can ask to be added to the do not post
list as part of your takedown request. However, you must have a recognizable
signature on every image, otherwise each piece would need to go through the
standard takedown procedure.
